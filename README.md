# powershell-startup-information
A super fast no-nonsense shell information startup script.

Copy and paste the contents from `Show-FastSystemInfo.sh` into your `$profile` and call `Show-FastSystemInfo` at the end of that file to get some supa fast system information on shell startup. (seriously it's fast)
